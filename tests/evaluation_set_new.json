The patient was admitted to the medical ward for ongoing management of his respiratory symptoms and blood pressure optimization. During his hospital stay, chest X-ray confirmed bilateral lower lobe infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. Blood pressure remained elevated despite previous antihypertensive therapy. The patient responded well to antibiotic therapy and respiratory support. His oxygen saturation improved to 98% on room air by discharge. Given his history of fluid retention and current presentation, he was stabilized on furosemide 40mg daily for diuresis and blood pressure control. The patient was discharged home in stable condition with close follow-up arranged with his primary care physician within one week. Discharge instructions included medication compliance, activity as tolerated, and return precautions for worsening shortness of breath or chest pain.",

Additionally, laboratory studies confirmed poorly controlled diabetes mellitus with HbA1c of 9.2%. The patient's blood glucose levels were stabilized during hospitalization with insulin therapy. Cardiology consultation recommended optimal medical management prior to consideration of revascularization procedures. Patient education was provided regarding diabetic diet and glucose monitoring. The patient was discharged on metformin 500mg twice daily to improve glycemic control. Comprehensive discharge planning included cardiac rehabilitation referral, endocrinology follow-up within 2 weeks, and strict dietary modifications. Patient counseled extensively on medication adherence and advised to monitor for any adverse reactions including gastrointestinal upset or signs of lactic acidosis.",

Renal ultrasound revealed bilateral cortical thinning consistent with chronic kidney disease. The patient also reported occasional wheezing and shortness of breath, particularly with exertion. Pulmonary function tests suggested mild reactive airway disease. During her hospital stay, blood pressure was gradually controlled with ACE inhibitor therapy. The patient was started on lisinopril 10mg daily for both hypertension management and renal protection. Additionally, albuterol metered-dose inhaler was prescribed for bronchodilation as needed for respiratory symptoms. Nephrology consultation was obtained and recommended regular monitoring of kidney function. Patient was discharged in improved condition with well-controlled blood pressure and resolution of respiratory symptoms.
